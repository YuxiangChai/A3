# A3: Android Agent Arena

This repo is for the 201 predefined tasks and evaluation.

The code is still under processing and re-construction (I am mainly working on the MLLM-as-a-judge part for a better evaluation process)

The plan is to release this repo by Jan 31. (Hope I will)

The MLLM-as-a-judge repo will be released by Feb 15, together with the updated A3 paper for a more detailed and well-developed auto evaluation.
